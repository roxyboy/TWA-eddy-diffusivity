A repository for Jupyter notebooks analyzing the thickness-weighted averaged (TWA) eddy diffusivity tensor using 24 ensemble members of the North Atlantic with micro initial conditions.

The corresponding manuscript is `Cautionary tales from the mesoscale eddy diffusivity tensor <https://doi.org/10.31223/X5CW62>`_ submitted to Ocean Modelling.

The passive tracer outputs are transformed to TWA variables in `TWA-tracers <https://github.com/roxyboy/TWA-eddy-diffusivity/blob/master/TWA-tracers.ipynb>`_, transport tensor in `Kappas_03-01-1967-5Dave <https://github.com/roxyboy/TWA-eddy-diffusivity/blob/master/Kappas_03-01-1967-5Dave.ipynb>`_, spatial correlation between the eddy flux and its reconstruction in `Spatial_correlation-5Dave <https://github.com/roxyboy/TWA-eddy-diffusivity/blob/master/Spatial_correlation-5Dave.ipynb>`_, and errors in `Errors <https://github.com/roxyboy/TWA-eddy-diffusivity/blob/master/Errors.ipynb>`_.

The Python environment used for this analysis is given in the `yaml file <https://github.com/roxyboy/TWA-eddy-diffusivity/blob/master/environment.yml>`_.
