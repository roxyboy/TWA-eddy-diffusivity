TWA eddy diffusivity
====================

A repository for Jupyter notebooks analyzing the thickness-weighted averaged (TWA) eddy diffusivity tensor using 24 ensemble members with micro initial conditions of the North Atlantic.

The corresponding manuscript is `Cautionary tales from the mesoscale eddy diffusivity tensor <https://doi.org/10.31223/X5CW62>`_ submitted to Ocean Modelling.

The Python environment used for this analysis is given in the `yaml file <environment_xgcm.txt>`_.
